Simple Controls
Use the 'A' and 'D' keys to move left and right and use the space bar to jump.

Teleporting Mechanic
Press the 'W' key to shoot a 'teleporting sphere'. The sphere's velocity and direction will be based on the mouse's position on the screen. Press the 'W' key again to freeze the sphere in mid-air. The air will stay there for a few seconds. Pressing the 'S' key while the sphere is frozen will create a platform and simultaneous teleport the player to the platform. The platform will last for a few seconds before disapparing. This is the main mechanic that I have been experimenting with.

# Other Game Info

TYou can press 1, 2, or 3 to create a shape (Square, Circle, or Triangle respectively). I used these to test the physics settings. You can only jump on the white blocks and the teleportation platform.
